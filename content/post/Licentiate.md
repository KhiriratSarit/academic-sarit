On 6th December 2019, I presented my works in the licentiate seminar titled "[__First-Order Algorithms for Communication Efficient Distributed Learning__
](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1369374&dswid=1526)". I defended with Professor [Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi) from EPFL, Lausanne,  Switzerland as my thesis opponent.
