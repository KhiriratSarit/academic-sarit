Sarit Khirirat received the Bechelors' degree in Electrical Engineering from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, in 2013; the Master's degree in Systems, Control and Robotics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, in 2017; and the PhD at the Division of Decision and Control Systems from the same institution in 2022. During his PhD, he did research on optimization in communication-efficient and federated learning applications under the supervision of Professor [Mikael Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~mikaelj/). This research program was funded by [the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software program](https://wasp-sweden.org/), Sweden's largest individual research program.

He will be a postdoctoral fellow in Machine Learning at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), advised by Professor [Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/) and Professor [Fakhreddine Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/karray).
